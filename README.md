# FullStack Challenge

This application is supposed to have a react front end and a python back end, the specifics for the challenge can be found on this [link](https://github.com/oncase/fullstack-challenge?tab=readme-ov-file)



## Steps of the challenge

Since I have little experience in backend development I decided to take this challenge in steps:

- ~~Start learning react for the front end development~~
- ~~Start learning springboot to make the front end more good looking quickly~~
- ~~Finish the base for the front end application~~
- ~~Choose a framework for the backend portion of the challenge (django, flask or FastAPI)~~
- Start the backend development and learn how to integrate it with the front end
- Adapt the front end to work with the data from the back end
- Make the front end send data to the back end
- deploy backend
- deploy frontend
